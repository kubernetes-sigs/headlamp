# Headlamp Plugins

> Headlamp features an extensible plugin system allowing developers to add custom functionality, UI elements, and integrations.

This file provides context for AI assistants specifically focused on developing Headlamp plugins. For core Headlamp development context, see the root `llms.txt` file.
