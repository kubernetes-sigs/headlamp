# Building the KEDA Plugin

Apply everything you've learned to build a production-ready plugin for [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling).

## What is KEDA?

KEDA extends Kubernetes with event-driven autoscaling. It introduces Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) like:

- **ScaledObject** — Scales deployments based on event triggers
- **ScaledJob** — Creates jobs based on events
- **TriggerAuthentication** — Securely connects to event sources
- **ClusterTriggerAuthentication** — Cluster-wide authentication

## What You'll Build

A complete KEDA management plugin featuring:

- ✅ Custom resource classes for KEDA CRDs
- ✅ List views with status columns
- ✅ Detail pages with trigger information
- ✅ Map visualization showing resource relationships
- ✅ Installation detection and user guidance

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, complete the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) tutorials (1-10).

You should also have:
- A Kubernetes cluster with KEDA installed ([KEDA installation guide](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/deploy/))
- Basic understanding of KEDA concepts

## Sneak Peek: What the KEDA Plugin Looks Like

The finished plugin provides:

### ScaledObject List View

A table showing all ScaledObjects with their status, triggers, and target deployments.

### ScaledObject Detail View

Detailed information including trigger configuration, status conditions, and related pods.

<!-- SCREENSHOT_PLACEHOLDER: ScaledObject detail view -->

### Map Visualization

Visual representation of ScaledObjects and their relationships to deployments and pods.

This is what we'll build together in these tutorials!
