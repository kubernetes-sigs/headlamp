## Introduction

**Headlamp** is an open-source, extensible Kubernetes web UI. It provides:

- A clean, modern interface for managing Kubernetes clusters
- Multi-cluster support
- A powerful plugin system for customization
- Desktop and in-cluster deployment options

Headlamp has three main components:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | TypeScript, React | The web UI you interact with |
| **Backend** | Go | API server that proxies requests to Kubernetes |
| **Desktop App** | Electron | Native app wrapper for macOS, Windows, Linux |

Building from source lets you modify Headlamp, develop plugins with live reload, and contribute to the project.

---

## Prerequisites

Install these tools before proceeding:

### Required

| Tool | Version | Installation |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Git** | Latest | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| **Node.js** | ≥22.0.0 LTS  | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) |
| **npm**     | ≥11.0.0      | Included with Node.js |
| **Go**      | ≥1.25.9      | [go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install) |

### Optional (for testing with a cluster)

| Tool | Purpose | Installation |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **minikube** | Local Kubernetes cluster | [minikube.sigs.k8s.io](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) |
| **kubectl** | Kubernetes CLI | [kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) |

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check versions
node --version    # Should be v22.0.0 or higher
npm --version     # Should be 11.0.0 or higher
go version        # Should be go1.25.9 or higher
git --version     # Any recent version
```

---

## Clone the Repository

### Option A: Fork First (for contributors)

1. Fork the repo at [github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp)
2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/headlamp.git
cd headlamp
```

### Option B: Clone Directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp.git
cd headlamp
```

---

## Repository Structure

Headlamp is organized as a monorepo with three main components: a React **frontend** for the UI, a Go **backend** that proxies requests to Kubernetes, and an Electron **app** for the desktop version. All build commands are orchestrated from the root `package.json`.

```
headlamp/
├── frontend/          # React/TypeScript web UI
│   ├── src/           # Source code, components, and tests
│   └── package.json   # Frontend dependencies
│
├── backend/           # Go server
│   ├── cmd/           # Main application entry point
│   ├── pkg/           # Reusable packages (auth, cache, helm, etc.)
│   └── go.mod         # Go dependencies
│
├── app/               # Electron desktop application
│   ├── electron/      # Main process code
│   └── package.json   # App dependencies
│
├── plugins/           # Plugin system
│   ├── examples/      # Example plugins to learn from
│   └── headlamp-plugin/  # Plugin development tools
│
├── docs/              # Documentation (markdown)
├── package.json       # Root scripts for building/running
└── README.md          # Project overview
```

**Key insight**: The root `package.json` contains npm scripts that orchestrate building and running all components. You'll use commands like `npm run backend:build` and `npm run frontend:start` from the root directory.

---

## Install Dependencies

From the repository root, install all dependencies:

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
npm run frontend:install

# Install app dependencies (only needed if running desktop app)
npm run app:install
```

> **Note**: Go dependencies are fetched automatically during the build step. No separate install is needed for the backend.

**Quick install everything:**

```bash
npm run install:all
```

---

## Build the Code

### Build Everything

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs `backend:build` and `frontend:build` sequentially.

### Build Individually

```bash
# Build backend only (compiles Go → backend/headlamp-server binary)
npm run backend:build

# Build frontend only (compiles TypeScript → frontend/build/)
npm run frontend:build
```

> **Note**: Building creates the artifacts but doesn't run them. See the next section to start Headlamp.

---

## Run in Development Mode

### Option 1: Run Both Together (Recommended)

```bash
npm start
```

This starts both backend and frontend with live reload. You'll see color-coded output:
- 🔵 Blue: Backend logs
- 🟢 Green: Frontend logs

![Screenshot of terminal output showing backend and frontend running with color-coded logs](./npm-start-terminal.png)

**Access points:**
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:4466](http://localhost:4466)

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see Headlamp's welcome screen:

![Screenshot of Headlamp running in a web browser showing the welcome screen](./headlamp-browser.png)

### Option 2: Run Separately (Two Terminals)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**

```bash
npm run backend:build   # Build first (required)
npm run backend:start
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**

```bash
npm run frontend:start
```

> **Tip**: Running separately is useful when you only want to restart one component.

---

## Run the Desktop App

The desktop app wraps the frontend and backend into a native application.

### Option 1: Full App Mode

Builds frontend and runs the complete Electron app:

```bash
npm run app:start
```

![Screenshot of the Headlamp desktop application window](./headlamp-desktop-app.png)

### Option 2: App-Only Mode (Development)

If you already have `npm start` running (backend + frontend), you can run just the Electron shell:

```bash
npm run app:start:client
```

This connects to your running dev servers—useful for faster iteration on app-specific code.

### Option 3: Everything Together

Run backend, frontend, and desktop app all at once:

```bash
npm run start:with-app
```

---

## Connect to a Kubernetes Cluster

Headlamp automatically detects Kubernetes clusters from your kubeconfig file. By default, it looks for the file at `~/.kube/config` on macOS/Linux or `%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config` on Windows. If you have multiple clusters configured, Headlamp will show all of them and let you switch between them.

> **Already have a cluster?** If you already have `kubectl` working with a cluster (try `kubectl get nodes`), you can skip to the next section—Headlamp will pick it up automatically.

### Quick Setup with minikube

```bash
# Start a local cluster
minikube start

# Verify it's running
kubectl get nodes
```

Now refresh Headlamp, it should detect your cluster automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find and kill process on port 3000 (frontend)
lsof -i :3000  # macOS/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :3000  # Windows

# Find and kill process on port 4466 (backend)
lsof -i :4466  # macOS/Linux
```

### Backend Won't Start

Ensure the binary exists:

```bash
ls backend/headlamp-server  # macOS/Linux
dir backend\headlamp-server.exe  # Windows
```

If missing, rebuild:

```bash
npm run backend:build
```

### Node/Go Version Mismatch

```bash
# Check versions match requirements
node --version  # Need ≥22.0.0
npm --version   # Need ≥11.0.0
go version      # Need ≥1.25.9
```

### kubeconfig Not Found

Headlamp looks for `~/.kube/config` by default. Verify it exists:

```bash
cat ~/.kube/config  # macOS/Linux
type %USERPROFILE%\.kube\config  # Windows
```

### Clean Rebuild

When in doubt, clean and rebuild:

```bash
npm run clean
npm run install:all
npm run build
```
