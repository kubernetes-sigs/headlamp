Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI.

Headlamp was created to blend the traditional feature set of other web UIs/dashboards
(i.e., to list and view resources) with added functionality.

Headlamp can be used [in-cluster](./installation/in-cluster), where it's accessed through a web browser,
or as a [desktop application](./installation/desktop) (using the information defined in the user's
kubeconfig).
